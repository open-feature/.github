## Contacting us

We hold regular meetings which you can see [here](https://github.com/open-feature/community/#meetings-and-events).

We are also present on the `#openfeature` channel in the [CNCF slack](https://slack.cncf.io/).

## Project Governance

Project governance is documented [here](https://github.com/open-feature/governance).
We plan to have open and vendor neutral governance in the project once it is fully established.
