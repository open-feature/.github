## Communication Channels

We plan to create the official Slack workspace later so that multiple workstreams and channels could be established there.
For now, we have an `#openfeature` Slack channel on the CNCF Slack Workspace.
See the joining guidelines [here](https://open-feature.github.io/home/participate/#slack)

## Meetings

Regular meetings will be established soon.

## Project Governance

Project governance is documented [here](https://github.com/open-feature/governance).
We plan to have open and vendor neutral governance in the project once it is fully established.

## Share feedback

For now, please share your feedback in the [sign-up form](https://bit.ly/openfeature-signup) that has optional fields for it.
More channels will be added later.
