## üëã Hey there! Thanks for checking out the OpenFeature your-repo

### What is OpenFeature?

[OpenFeature][openfeature-website] is an open standard that provides a vendor-agnostic, community-driven API for feature flagging that works with your favorite feature flag management tool.

### Why standardize feature flags?

Standardizing feature flags unifies tools and vendors behind a common interface which avoids vendor lock-in at the code level. Additionally, it offers a framework for building extensions and integrations and allows providers to focus on their unique value proposition.

## üîß Components 

<!-- TODO: if this is a monorepo, link to the submodule README files here and include the requirements, installation, features, and usage there. Otherwise, exclude this section -->

## üîç Requirements:

<!-- TODO: required runtime, etc -->

## üì¶ Installation:

<!-- TODO: installation instructions -->

## üåü Features:

- support for various backend [providers](https://openfeature.dev/docs/reference/concepts/provider)
- easy integration and extension via [hooks](https://openfeature.dev/docs/reference/concepts/hooks)
- bool, string, numeric and object flag types
- [context-aware](https://openfeature.dev/docs/reference/concepts/evaluation-context) evaluation

## üöÄ Usage:

### Basics:

<!-- TODO: code examples featuring setting a provider, getting a client, waiting for PROVIDER_READY, and doing an evaluation -->

You can also bind a provider to a specific client by name, instead of setting that provider globally:

<!-- TODO: example of named client binding -->

### Context-aware evaluation:

Sometimes the value of a flag must take into account some dynamic criteria about the application or user, such as the user location, IP, email address, or the location of the server.
In OpenFeature, we refer to this as [`targeting`](https://openfeature.dev/specification/glossary#targeting).
If the flag system you're using supports targeting, you can provide the input data using the `EvaluationContext`.

<!-- TODO: code examples using context and different levels -->

### Events

Events allow you to react to state changes in the provider or underlying flag management system, such as flag definition changes, provider readiness, or error conditions.

<!-- TODO: code example of a PROVIDER_CONFIGURATION_CHANGED event -->

### Providers:

To develop a provider, you need to create a new project and include the OpenFeature SDK as a dependency. This can be a new repository or included in [the existing contrib repository](https://github.com/open-feature/java-sdk-contrib) available under the OpenFeature organization. Finally, you‚Äôll then need to write the provider itself. This can be accomplished by implementing the `Provider` interface exported by the OpenFeature SDK.

<!-- TODO: update with the technology in question -->
See [here](https://openfeature.dev/docs/reference/technologies/server/javascript) for a catalog of available providers.

### Hooks:

Hooks are a mechanism that allow for the addition of arbitrary behavior at well-defined points of the flag evaluation life-cycle. Use cases include validation of the resolved flag value, modifying or adding data to the evaluation context, logging, telemetry, and tracking.
